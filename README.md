Required Components :
- App integrates a third-party library; Firebase is used
- App validates all input from servers and users. If data does not exist or is in the wrong format, the app logs this fact and does not crash.

- App keeps all strings in a strings.xml file and enables RTL layout switching on all layouts.
- App provides a widget to provide relevant information to the user on the home screen.
- App integrates two or more Google services
- Each service imported in the build.gradle is used in the app. If Location is used, the app customizes the user’s experience by using the device’s location.

- App is equipped with a signing configuration, and the keystore and passwords are included in the repository. Keystore is referred to by a relative path.
- All app dependencies are managed by Gradle. 
- App implements a ContentProvider to access locally stored data.
- Must implement at least one of the three :
⋅⋅⋅ If it regularly pulls or sends data to/from a web service or API, app updates data in its cache at regular intervals using a SyncAdapter. OR If it needs to pull or send data to/from a web service or API only once, or on a per request basis (such as a search application), app uses an IntentService to do so. OR If it performs short duration, on-demand requests(such as search), app uses an AsyncTask.
- App uses a Loader to move its data to its views.
